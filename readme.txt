The Reading Time & Progress Bar plugin enhances your blog with an estimated reading time and a stylish progress bar.


== Description ==

Do you find that potential readers frequently bypass your posts due to concerns about the time investment? Are you inadvertently losing valuable readership as a result?

The Reading Time & Progress Bar plugin effortlessly showcases the estimated reading duration for blog articles, coupled with an engaging progress bar. This feature not only provides visitors with a swift understanding of the time commitment required for reading a post but also serves as a motivating factor to encourage them to read through to the conclusion.

Typically, visitors initially attempt to scan an entire post, aiming to glean as much information as possible at a glance. By specifying the reading time in minutes, this approach not only engages users but also serves as a powerful motivator to encourage them to delve into the post's content.

Enhance the reader's experience with a user-friendly progress bar that elegantly tracks their position within the post. As readers scroll through the content, this sleek progress bar provides real-time feedback, visually illustrating the remaining portion of the post. This intuitive feature not only informs readers of their progress but also guides them effortlessly through the article, offering a clear sense of how far they've come and how much more lies ahead.


This plugin employs a cutting-edge image time calculation method to enhance your content. If your post includes images, the plugin seamlessly calculates the time required to view these visuals. You have the flexibility to customize this experience by setting the desired pace, specifying the number of images per minute, ensuring a tailored and engaging reading journey for your audience.
